## 💡 About

**ArchScriptGen** is a GUI-based tool that helps you generate complete Arch Linux installation and configuration scripts using AI.

Built with **PyQt6 + Groq API**, it simplifies the complex Arch setup process into an intuitive visual workflow.

---

## ✨ Features

* 🖥️ Modern GUI built with PyQt6
* 🤖 AI-powered script generation (Groq - LLaMA 3.3)
* 🎨 Theme selection with live preview
* 🧩 Desktop Environment chooser (GNOME, KDE, i3, XFCE, etc.)
* 📦 Search and install apps from Arch repositories
* 🖱️ Cursor theme selection
* ⚙️ Advanced system configuration:

  * Bootloader selection
  * Kernel selection
  * User & hostname setup
  * Network & drivers
* 🌐 Wallpaper & dotfiles integration
* 💾 Export scripts as `.sh` files

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Download the latest version from **Releases**
2. Extract the `.zip` file
3. Open the folder
4. Run:

```bash
ArchScriptGen.exe
```

5. Enter your Groq API key when prompted
6. Start generating your Arch install script

## ⚠️ Requirements

* Windows OS
* Internet connection (required for API + package search)

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Select your system preferences (DE, apps, drivers, etc.)
2. The app sends your request to Groq AI
3. AI generates a complete Arch Linux bash script
4. You can review and export it
